# blender_renderig

In order to run the rendering `blender` executable should be on system path.
Blender 2.80 was used on the experiments.

Structure:
* `scripts/render.py` is the script that invokes blender and starts the rendering process
* The folder `rendinring` contains Blender specific code that will be run inside Blender
